TurboDash was created by Brayan CataÃ±o Giraldo and Santiago Mejia Orejuela in 2023.

'''
The pygame and sys library is imported to manage TurboDash utilities such as image loading, 
button creation and others, also its system functions, as well as the files needed to execute these tasks.
'''

The settings class is initialized.

The pygame.mixer library is imported to play the background music of the game.

The list_buttons() function is the function in charge of creating the buttons and 
adding them to a list of buttons. It has no input parameters and as output parameters
