Button class with its respective attributes and methods. On input, it is sent the x-position, 
y-position, width, height, image, hover image and the action to be performed by the button.
'''
class Button:
	def __init__(self, x, y, width, height, image, hover_image, action):
		self.rect = pygame.Rect(x, y, width, height)
		self.image = image
		self.hover_image = hover_image
		self.action = action
		self.is_hovered = False

	'''
  The draw(self, screen) method is used to draw the button depending on the screen dimensions to be used.
  '''	
	def draw(self, screen):
		if self.is_hovered:
			screen.blit(self.hover_image, self.rect.topleft)
		else:
			screen.blit(self.image, self.rect.topleft)

	'''
  The check_hover(self, screen) method is used to check whether to display the hover image.
  '''
	def check_hover(self, pos):
		self.is_hovered = self.rect.collidepoint(pos)

	'''
  The perform_action(self, screen) method is used to call the action to be performed.
  '''
	def perform_action(self):
		if self.action is not None:
				self.action()
		else:
				print("No action assigned to button")
